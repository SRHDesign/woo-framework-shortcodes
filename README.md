# woo-framework-shortcodes
WooThemes uses WooFramework which comes with loads of shortcodes, if you have used the theme for a long time you may have used the 
shortcodes in your pages. Switching over to another theme becomes difficult as the shortcodes aren't supported in a non WooTheme. 
With the help of this plugin easily switch to a non WooThemes theme but retain the framework shortcodes.
